    <h2>WEEK 1</h2>

    <br>

    <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
    </h3>
    <p>The first thing I had paid attention to was the sites loading screen. Whilst loading, the site displayed the words "it is now safe to turn of your computer" in large, bold text. It was clear the site would have a retro-esque theme to its design as the words would glitch similarily to a vhs tape.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Clicking on the floating buttons which would open a text notification</li>
        <li>Pressing Ok to each notification that would pop up.</li>
        <li>Clicking on an option to 'scream into void', which would direct me to a new site.</li>
        <li>Writing a prompt on the 'scream into the void' site and submitting scream.</li>
        <li>Attempting to exit out of more windows, being led to a site saying my computer was infected with cyberzombies.</li>
        <li>Clicking a button that lead me to the sites terms and conditions with the mouse icon being turned into an animated cat.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h3>
    <p>I had initially spent a majority of my time experimenting with what can and cannot be clicked on the site as the many pop up windows and floating buttons made it difficult to navigate around. However, once i had found out that the constant pop ups were just introductory to the site, i had spent most of my time engaging with its next act being a simulation of a desktop homescreen.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
    </h3>
    <p>My most common action was clicking multiple x icons and replying to the pop up notifications that would appear as a result of trying to exit certain windows.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
    </h3>
    <p>I felt as though the primary goal was to completely overwhelm the user when entering the site, to which it successfully did to me. I had also gotten the impression that the site aimed to create an overexaggeration of the early interweb.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <p>The site almost mimics a user having a potential virus on their browser, the constant windows and notifications popping up on the screen was more than enough to overwhelm me. There was so much happening on the screen I wasnt sure on what to exactly focus on.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? 
        (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <p>As there seems to be a hidden story to this site, I believe you may be able to interact with it for longer than 30 minutes if an individual were to constantly trial and error different interactions. 
        I don't believe someone would stay on this site for longer than an hour as the visuals are quite overstimulating with its bright use of colours, flashing lights, loud audio and pop-ups.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
    <p>As there are many interactive elements present in the site, a user can always return with a new discovery. 
        I had found that because of the abundance of imagery and buttons floating around the screen, I had missed additional text information or other interactive icons on the site to which i only found from constantly returning and clicking through. 
        With more information given from their last experience, a user is able to navigate through the site and its story a whole lot faster.</p>

    <h2>WEEK 2</h2>

    <br>

    <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
    <p>The experience places great reference to the internet in its 90's to early 2000's as it was still developing in design. The old school virus and outdated icons showcased throughout the site display where the site takes its inspiration from.</p>
    
    <br>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <p>A user may be more inclined to visit the additional creations from the artists behind this site as it strays from many modern sites. The chaotic appearance may appeal towards a niche audience.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <p>I feel as though the sites reference to the early 2000's internet is made to give you a sense of nostalgia, especially for individuals who have experienced and discovered the many different aspects of the web growing up. The sites and games displayed in their pixelated and unusual appearance may make some users feel old from its dated design.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3> What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
    <p>I feel as though the constant effort to exit the pop ups were annoying, despite its intentions to mimic a virus. It was frustrating being sent to another site without a warning every so often after clicking a button, however I understand that that is a part of the sites design.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>

    <p>The most satisfying part was exploring the short story within the sites simulated desktop. I really enjoyed the clues and steps the site would guide me towards into uncovering further elements which felt like a fast mini game.</p>
