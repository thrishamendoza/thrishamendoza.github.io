        <title>julies plants</title>

<!--the title pays homage to my mom who absolutely adores her plants and cares for them every single day, almost as if they
were her own child. ive always taken appreaciation over the amount of effort she takes to water and ensure they live long lives, and im always stunned
to discover just how large ehr knowledge of caring for certain plants are. a sweet lady caring for her sweet plants :)-->

            i had difficulties writing a functional code for more than one to run successfully, therefore i am leaving them here to further show my experimentation
        this is probably another one of those things that can be rather simplified and organised in a much neater manner which i am totally aware of, however i just am not sure how
    to go about it successfully :(. -->

<!--the use of floating plants was a creative choice i decided to keep as it closely resembled one of the sites and had looked into for inspiration and reasearch
for this project, its slightly unsettling due to the many mixed media you see just on one page, but thats what i enjoy the most.
its a sort of style that looks bad and good at thesame time, as if a child was working alongside an adult.-->
